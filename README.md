# Zoom-Features-Release
This project is about finding out how many features will be released in future by zoom by training the present available released versions.
I compared the predicted values to the actual data that was available for the anticipated periods to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. This comparison aids the assessment of the SARIMAmodel’s accuracy and sheds light on how well it can identify underlying trends, seasonality,and other pertinent patterns in the data.
The findings show how well the SARIMA model predicts sequential data, and they serve as the foundation for additional analysis and interpretation in the report’s sections.
The temporal dependencies in the “ASN3-Run1-Dataset”,”ASN3-Run2-Dataset” , “ASN3-Run3-Dataset” have been successfully captured by applying the SARIMA model to time seriesforecasting. For well-informed decision-making, the precise forecasts and comprehension of seasonal trends in the data provide insightful information. 
This research opens the door to more sophisticated forecasting methods and offers a strong basis for continuing data-driven efforts.
To sum up, the SARIMA model is a useful tool for comprehending and forecasting sequentialdata, and it may be applied in a variety of sectors where time series analysis is crucial.
